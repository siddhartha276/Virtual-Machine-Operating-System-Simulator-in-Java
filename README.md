# Virtual Machine Operating System Simulator in Java

This project is a Java-based simulator designed to emulate the functionalities of a virtual machine operating system. It processes input commands, executes operations, and simulates system-level functionalities.

## Features

- **Phase1**: Responsible for loading and parsing input commands.
- **Phase2**: Handles the execution of parsed commands and manages system resources.
- **File Handling**: Reads input commands from a file and writes the output results.
- **Process Management**: Simulates scheduling and execution of instructions.
- **Memory Management**: Simulates memory allocation and deallocation.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error-checking mechanisms for invalid instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A terminal or command prompt

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siddhartha276/Virtual-Machine-Operating-System-Simulator-in-Java.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Virtual-Machine-Operating-System-Simulator-in-Java
   ```

### Running the Simulator

1. **Compile the Java Files**:
   ```bash
   javac Phase1.java Phase2.java
   ```

2. **Run the Simulator**:
   ```bash
   java Phase1 input.txt
   java Phase2 input.txt
   ```
   Replace `input.txt` with your desired input file.

## Input and Output

- **input.txt**: Contains the commands or data for the simulator to process.
- **output.txt**: Stores the simulation results after execution.
